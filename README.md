I'm passionate about cybersecurity/IT infrastructure and love tackling complex challenges through hands-on projects. From vulnerability management to threat detection, these projects allow me to dive deep into the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity. Please feel free to check them out and see the work I’ve put into enhancing security operations and processes!


## ⚠️ Vulnerability Management Projects

-- **Designed an end-to-end vulnerability management workflow using Tenable.io, including scanning, prioritization, and remediation governance. Documented lifecycle processes, SLAs, KPIs, and asset risk models aligned to industry best practices.**

- **[Vulnerability Management Program Implementation](https://github.com/mdelarosa-cyber/Vulnerability-Management-Program/tree/main)**

## 🚨 Threat Hunting and Security Operations

-- **Developed a threat hunting use case to identify Tor exit node traffic. Built KQL detections in Microsoft Sentinel, analyzed network indicators, and documented hypotheses, procedures, and response steps.**

- **[Threat Hunting Scenario (Tor Browser Usage)](https://github.com/mdelarosa-cyber/Threat-Hunting-Scenario-Tor)**

### 🔐 Windows 11 STIG Remediation (Azure VM + Tenable + PowerShell)

-- **A hands-on security hardening project where I scanned an Azure Windows 11 VM using Tenable, identified failed DISA STIG audit checks, and remediated them using automated PowerShell scripts.**

- **[Windows 11 STIG Remediation](https://github.com/mdelarosa-cyber/STIGs_Remediation)**

### 🚨 SOC Analyst Investigation: Credential Theft, Persistence, C2, and Exfiltration Hunt

-- **Conducted a full-scope threat hunt and incident analysis demonstrating SOC Analyst investigation workflows, KQL hunting, and MITRE ATT&CK alignment.**

- **[Azuki Case Study- SOC Analyst Threat hunt](https://github.com/mdelarosa-cyber/Azuki-Incident-Full-Threat-Hunt-Report/blob/main/README.md)**

### 🌐 Enterprise DHCP Configuration in Azure

-- **Configured a multi-scope Windows Server DHCP environment in Microsoft Azure, including exclusions, lease management, and reservations. This project simulates real-world enterprise network administration for user, voice, and guest networks.**
